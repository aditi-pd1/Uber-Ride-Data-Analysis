# Uber-Ride-Data-Analysis
To leverage Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries to extract actionable insights from Uber rides data and uncover trends in peak hours, popular routes, and rider behavior to optimize operations and improve service.

# Importing Libraries
The analysis will be done using the following libraries : 
1. `Pandas`:  This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
2. `Numpy`: Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
3. `Matplotlib` / `Seaborn`: This library is used to draw visualizations.

# Highlights
1. `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Understand the data's structure, clean and preprocess it, and visualize key metrics like trip distance, duration, and fare amount.
2. `Peak Hours and Days`: Identify the busiest times of the day and week to optimize driver allocation and pricing strategies.
3. `Popular Routes`: Analyze frequently traveled routes to optimize service and potentially introduce dynamic pricing.
4. `Rider Behavior`: Understand rider preferences, such as preferred payment methods, car types, and trip purposes.
5. `Geographic Analysis`: Visualize trip density maps to identify high-demand areas and potential expansion opportunities.
6. `Predictive Modeling`: Use machine learning techniques to predict future demand, optimize pricing, and improve service quality.
7. `A/B Testing`: Experiment with different strategies (e.g., pricing, promotions) to measure their impact on rider behavior and revenue.

# Get Started
1. `git clone https://github.com/aditi-pd1/Uber-Ride-Data-Analysis.git` to clone the project
2. `cd Uber-Ride-Data-Analysis` to enter the project directory.
3. `python ./analysis.py` to execute.
4. The `.ipynb` file is also available.

# Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher must be installed in your device.
